# SmartEntrySystem
CITS5506 Group Project Repo

## Project Title: IOT Temperature & Mask Scan Entry System
### Description: 
This project addresses the need for automated influenza prevention measures at entry points by developing a system that checks both temperature and mask compliance. The system uses a contactless temperature sensor and camera to scan individuals and transmits the results to a mobile or web application for display. Controlled by a Raspberry Pi, the system allows for real-time monitoring without the need for physical barriers. This solution is ideal for high-traffic environments like airports, offices, and public spaces. In the future, this project could evolve to include an automatic gate system that integrates with barriers to automatically prevent entry if unsafe conditions are detected.
 
### Components: Raspberry Pi, Temperature Sensor, Camera, ESP8266 WiFi Module, etc.
Applications: Railways, Airports, Offices, Public Spaces
Advantages: Fully automated, real-time result display
Disadvantages: Requires power supply, needs a reliable internet connection
