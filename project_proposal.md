3. Why do you want to do this project; What is the problem? What is the benefit of its solution? What is the impact of the solution?

    **Why Do You Want to Do This Project?**<br>
    The motivation for this project stems from the inefficiencies and challenges observed in the current methods of temperature screening and mask compliance checks in China, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Manual temperature checks at entry points, particularly in high-traffic areas like workplaces, have proven to be slow and inefficient. Typically, only one staff member is stationed at an entrance, leading to bottlenecks and delays. Moreover, this manual approach cannot prevent individuals from bypassing the screening process, which poses a significant risk to public health. With the ongoing normalization of COVID-19, there is a critical need for a more efficient and reliable solution that can be integrated into daily operations without requiring extensive human resources.

    **What Is the Problem?**<br>
    The primary issue with the current manual temperature screening process is its inefficiency and unreliability. Personnel are often not well trained in using temperature scanners, which leads to frequent human errors in reading temperature values. These errors can result in individuals with higher temperatures or without masks being allowed entry. Additionally, the manual process is highly dependent on the presence and vigilance of the staff. If supervisors are not watching, the scanning process might be skipped altogether, which further undermines the effectiveness of the health screening. During peak hours, such as the start of the workday, the influx of people makes it difficult for a single person to manage the screening process efficiently. This not only slows down entry but also wastes valuable human resources that could be better utilized elsewhere.


    **What Is the Benefit of Its Solution?**<br>
    The proposed solution—a fully automated temperature scanner and entry control system—addresses these problems by eliminating the need for human intervention in the screening process. The system uses a contactless temperature sensor and a camera to monitor mask compliance, both connected to a Raspberry Pi, which controls the entire operation. This automation ensures that each individual is screened quickly and accurately without the risk of human error. By integrating the system with a barrier mechanism, it can also physically prevent entry for those who do not meet the necessary health criteria, such as having a high temperature or not wearing a mask.

    This automated system can be installed at multiple entry points, significantly increasing the speed and efficiency of the screening process, especially during peak times. This not only improves the flow of people entering the premises but also ensures that health protocols are consistently enforced. Additionally, the system frees up personnel from the monotonous task of manual screening, allowing them to focus on more critical tasks.

    **What Is the Impact of the Solution?**<br>
    The impact of this automated system is substantial, particularly in environments with high foot traffic, such as offices, airports, and public spaces. By automating the health screening process, the system enhances the accuracy and reliability of temperature checks and mask compliance, reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission and other infectious diseases. The system’s ability to operate multiple units simultaneously at different entry points ensures that large crowds can be managed efficiently, without compromising safety.

    Moreover, the integration of IoT capabilities allows the system to transmit real-time data to a central server, enabling authorities to monitor the situation and respond swiftly if a potential case is detected. This real-time monitoring capability is crucial for maintaining public safety and mitigating the spread of diseases. Overall, the solution not only addresses the current inefficiencies in manual health screening but also provides a scalable, reliable, and efficient system that can be adapted to various high-traffic settings, ultimately contributing to a safer and healthier environment.


4. What are the existing solutions? (Literature Review)

5. How will you do it? Explain your methodology in a logical manner (step by step process). Draw a block diagram of the complete system. Explain design in terms of subsystems, their functionalities (software and Hardware) and their interdependence.

6. As sub teams are made, and project divided into tasks for sub teams then write initial distribution of work among students by mutual discussion (as per strengths of the members). You may change it during the project.

|Name of Student|Work Assigned|Reason for the Assignment|
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------|
|Ming Gao| Documentation, Video Editing| Ming has years of working experience with paperwork and has used video editing software before|
|Jingtong Peng| Hardware researching and development, Design and Architecture| Jingtong has working experience in embedded system programming|
|Tang Fung Leung| User Interface Development & Testing | Tang has experience in agile web development

7. A well-defined timeline related to subsystems should be made. Tasks should be assigned to sub-teams (refer above 8) and Timeline should cater for interdependence (parallel or sequential) of the subsystems.

8. Hardware required (Each group has $50 budget for the items (not including cost of items and sensors available at UWA)). Due to delivery time consideration, you should choose items from Jaycar and Altronics. Consult Andy our Lab Technician (Email andrew.burrell@uwa.edu.au), as there could be alternate items already at UWA, thus saving the delivery time.
