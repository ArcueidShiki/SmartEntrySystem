# CITS5506: Internet of Things
# Project Proposal: Smart Entry System
1. Name of Project: 

    **Smart Entry System**

2. Group Number, Names and Student Numbers of team members:
    
    Team 41<br>
    24162835 Joaquin Cornejo Lema<br> 
    24323312 Jingtong Peng<br>
    23891727 Tang Fung Leung<br> 
    24177876  Ming Gao<br>

3. Why do you want to do this project; What is the problem? What is the benefit of its solution? What is the impact of the solution?

4. What are the existing solutions? (Literature Review)

5. How will you do it? Explain your methodology in a logical manner (step by step process). Draw a block diagram of the complete system. Explain design in terms of subsystems, their functionalities (software and Hardware) and their interdependence.

6. As sub teams are made, and project divided into tasks for sub teams then write initial distribution of work among students by mutual discussion (as per strengths of the members). You may change it during the project.

|Name of Student|Work Assigned|Reason for the Assignment|
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------|
|Ming Gao| Documentation, Video Editing| Ming has years of working experience with paperwork and has used video editing software before|
|Jingtong Peng| Hardware researching and development, Design and Architecture| Jingtong has working experience in embedded system programming|
|Tang Fung Leung| User Interface Development & Testing | Tang has experience in agile web development

7. A well-defined timeline related to subsystems should be made. Tasks should be assigned to sub-teams (refer above 8) and Timeline should cater for interdependence (parallel or sequential) of the subsystems.

8. Hardware required (Each group has $50 budget for the items (not including cost of items and sensors available at UWA)). Due to delivery time consideration, you should choose items from Jaycar and Altronics. Consult Andy our Lab Technician (Email andrew.burrell@uwa.edu.au), as there could be alternate items already at UWA, thus saving the delivery time.
